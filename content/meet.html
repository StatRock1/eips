<h2>EIPS Meetings</h2>
<p>EIPS meetings occur twice a month. </p>
<h3>Critiques</h3>
<p>Critiques are the subject of one of the monthly meetings.  The link below provides more information about the program.</p>

<h3>Other Monthly Meeting Activities</h3>
<p>At non-critique meetings, the focus is on education and the practice of taking pictures. EIPS members sometimes go on outings or take pictures under conditions arranged at the meeting site such as pictures of objects under special lighting.  More information about such excursions and in-house meetings is in the link below.</p>

<p>Presentations are another possible activity, especially when the weather is too cold for picture taking outside.  Sometimes guest speakers are invited.  At other times, members pass photo tips to the rest of the club by making presentations.  The presentations may be about how to use photo software to improve one's images, or about other aspects of photography.  The link below leads to source materials for four of the past member presentations.</p>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>Usually the first meeting of the year is a potluck.  We vote for new officers and consider possible activities for the upcoming year.</p>
<p>We often do not meet in the first week in July.  It is near the July 4 Independence Day holiday and many members are not available to come.  We might also miss a meeting if its timing conflicts with some special event that most of the members would want to attend instead.  An example of this situation is having the Eastern Idaho State Fair Photography Awards night occur on one of our regular meeting nights.  A meeting may also be omitted if, instead, a weekend event or field trip is available to visit for a photo shoot.</p>
<p>We maintain a list of email addresses for our members.  Email is often the most convenient way to notify us about schedule changes.  As the information becomes available, we will also post it on the club's FaceBook page and on this website. </p>
